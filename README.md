Public Repository for B. Borrello Therapy Website
I designed, developed, and deployed a secure website using AWS services, showcasing my ability to leverage cloud architecture for a production-ready solution. This project demonstrates end-to-end implementation, including hosting, security, serverless functionality, and monitoring.
•	Static Hosting: Coded the website in HTML/CSS and hosted it on Amazon S3 with public static website hosting enabled.
•	DNS Management: Configured Amazon Route 53 for domain registration and routing, enabling seamless access.
•	HTTPS Security: Implemented TLS certificates via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and distributed the website globally through CloudFront, ensuring secure and efficient delivery.
•	Serverless Contact Form: Developed a dynamic contact form using:
o	AWS Lambda to process form submissions.
o	Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to send email notifications upon successful submissions.
o	API Gateway for routing form data to Lambda securely, with CORS enabled for frontend integration.
•	Troubleshooting & Monitoring: Utilised CloudWatch Logs for debugging and validation, ensuring robust functionality.
•	Frontend Integration: Implemented a fetch-based contact form in HTML to call the API Gateway endpoint, redirecting users on success and displaying errors on failure.
Successfully delivered a production-grade, secure, and scalable serverless website leveraging AWS services. Demonstrated expertise in full project lifecycle management, resolving complex challenges, and implementing cloud best practices. Optimised for cost efficiency and scalability using CloudFront, S3, and Lambda, while ensuring robust security with HTTPS via ACM. Set up monitoring and troubleshooting with CloudWatch, ensuring reliability and seamless user experience. This project highlights transferable skills in cloud architecture, problem-solving, and deploying enterprise-level solutions.
